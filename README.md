# Galaxy Rotation Curves

This repository contains a Python code to perform fits to experimental data of galaxy rotation curves.

Objective

Fit observational velocity data as a function of galactic radius using regression methods.

Compute the fit parameters, their uncertainties, and the residual variance.

Evaluate the quality of the fit through the fraction of explained variance.

Visualize and save the resulting plot.
